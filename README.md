The purpose of this repo is to try out Solana development and get a taste of it's ecosystem by calling solana system program to transact SOL token

First things first, let's initiate a node project with npm init and set type as module in package.json file so that we can encorporate the Import.

We need two wallets to go on, so install the solana CLI and create a filebase wallet json file and for the second a phantom chrome extension for an alternate wallet system.

Using @solana/Web3 an abstract layer over solana JSON RPC api, to transact with solana network to read and write data. 

For futue When I get there I will Update this repo to sample how we can serialize and deserialize data to interact with other Solana Programs are one's developed for a custom read.
